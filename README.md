Mousehunt AutoBot Enhanced Edition

This is an enhanced version of the script written by Ooiks.

	* Burroughs Rift (Green) – hunter remain in Green Zone. Mist canister charged in 6 -> 18 -> 6 ->18 -> …

	* Sunken City – auto arm EAC while diving at Treasure Zone, Special Zone & Monster Trench

	* All LG Area – auto arm Blue / Red / Yellow Sponge charm in LG/TG, auto arm Searcher / Bravery / Shine / Clarity charm in LC / CC, auto arm Grubling Chow / Super Salt / Salt / Grub Scent charm in SD / SC.

	* Halloween(2014) – swap cheese when reached area limit.

Additional features are under development at the moment such as FW, ZT, etc.

This script is tested under Chrome 37. It may not work at Firefox.
